<h1>A Tic Tac Toe game using JS, CSS, HTML</h1>
<ul>
  
<li>The intent is to have two people play based on two varuables that differ dependent on the player (ex. player 1 is X and player 2 is O)</li>

<li>We need a build of 9 squares using grid or flexbox, have the squares be interactive with the the two players</li>

<li>Have the two players have protocols to follow regarding make the game fair. (no double turns, no taking same spaces, declare who the winner is!</li>

<li>Manipulate the dom to display alert for winner and any changes within gameplay.</li>

<li>After basic structure is set up and functions work. make the front end user look more appealing( pictures fancy title etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Mouse Hover effect</h2>
<p>So basically I wanted to make sure it was both visually appealing but mobilizing as well. So I made it an objective to have a hover display that shows the image below to present which square to slect for your turn choice. Little did I know playing it on a mobile device made it feel even better, as you could play relevatively easy on any mobile platform or device.</p>
